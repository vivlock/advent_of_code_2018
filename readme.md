I'm using this as an excuse to practice my Ruby and flex my programming muscles.

Each day has its own folder. Day 1 had its part 1 code overwritten before I considered saving this for reference and/or portfolio use. Each day should have input file(s) and at least one script to solve the puzzle, and may additionally have some sandbox code where I played around to learn something.
